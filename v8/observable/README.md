Compiler plugin to support [observable notebooks](https://observablehq.com)

It's pretty rough:

* Stylesheets are nonexistant
* Only 2-file metadata support
* You will have to manually export your notebook and put the js file where you want it

It's probably a better idea to use Jupyter notebooks, but hey, alternatives!
